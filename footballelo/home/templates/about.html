  <p >
    This site is based of the ELO system developed by Dr.Arpad. This
    is the system used in chess. A modified version is used here for the top
    football clubs of Europe.

    Here's rating based on the following formula's<br/>
    R<sub>n</sub>=R<sub>0</sub>+KÃ—(W-W<sub>e</sub>)<br/><br/>
    Where R<sub>n</sub> is the new rating, R<sub>0</sub> is the old ratings.
    K is the weighting constant, here league matches are weighted at 30.
    W is the result, with wins being worth 1.0, draws are worth 0.5, and losses are worth 0.0
    . W<sub>E</sub> is the expected results. Its calculated with 1/(10<sup>-dr/400</sup>+1).
    dr is the difference of ELO ratings.
